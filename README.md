These folders contain MSX BASIC programs that I wrote a few years ago:

New Music 2001: a rewrite of a music program by the same name that I wrote back in 1990. Many years after losing the original, I decided to rewrite it from memory. Runs on MSX2 or higher.

New Music 2009: the same exact 2001 version except it runs only on Turbo-R and takes advantage of the R-800 speed.

Matrices: I initially wrote it for GWBASIC back in 1994 and I kept the source code. I decided in 2010 to convert it to MSX. Runs on MSX2 or higher.
